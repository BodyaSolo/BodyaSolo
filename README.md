## Hi, I'm Bohdan 👋
I'm a Developer based in Kyiv ☀️.

I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding and web platform.

I write standards based code that is semantic, accessible, search-engine friendly, easy to maintain, cross browser compatible, and performant.
Building a future-proof and easy-to-maintain website is achieved by breaking down a web page into its smallest pieces, often called components, and building them in a way that exists outside the context of the design they first appear in. This allows for components that can be re-used in other areas of a website as it grows and makes the intention easier for other developers to understand and test.

I have a special interest in use of animation on the web. I particularly like working on websites that have seamless transitions and require high-level performance to maintain a smooth and appealing website.
